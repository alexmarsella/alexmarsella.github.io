- "The effect of monitoring and crowds on crime and law enforcement: A natural experiment from European football" (w. B. Humphreys & L. Perez), under review at <i> Oxford Bulletin of Economics and Statistics</i>.
  - <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> Technological advancements like the presence of smart phones and body cameras have led to increased monitoring of police, but little evidence exists on their impact.  We address these problems using data on fouls from football matches in five European football leagues over six seasons.  This period contains exogenous changes in monitoring rule enforcers through introduction of Video Assistant Referee review and limited ``bystanders'' from Covid-19 restrictions.  Results from difference-in-differences models estimated separately for each league indicate that both events influenced the number of fouls called with substantial heterogeneity across leagues and home/away teams. </details>

## Works in Progress
- "Supervised Injection and NIMBY in Philadelphia: A Contingent Valuation Experiment" 
  - <details> <summary>Abstract</summary> Fentanyl overdose is the number one cause of death for Americans aged 18-45. Recently, an organization known as Safehouse attempted to open a ``Supervised-Injection Facility" in South Philadelphia. Here, intravenous drug-users would be able to use drugs under medical supervision and without legal repercussions within the walls of the facility. Upon progressing past legal hurdles and planning a relatively short-noticed opening, the organization faced immense backlash and ``not in my backyard'' (NIMBY) sentiment from the local community, ultimately leading to the cancellation of the site. This paper applies standard discrete-choice and contingent valuation survey techniques to this novel scenario in the city of Philadelphia. I find strong evidence of a NIMBY effect, where approximately one half of respondents who support the opening of an SIF relatively far away from them oppose or are unsure of its placement within a mile of their residence. I also find that a randomly assigned information treatment is effective in increasing respondents' openness to an SIF in their area. Additionally, I find that the perceived cost to residents of an SIF on their block is high: potentially thousands of dollars per month. </details>
