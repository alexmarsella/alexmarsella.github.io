## Works in Progress

- "Soda Taxes and Fecundability: Evidence from US Cities"
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary> This paper provides the first causal analysis of whether Sugar-Sweetened Beverage (SSB) taxes inadvertently led to increased fecundability within the population. I perform a synthetic control analysis using county-level natality data. Preliminary results forthcoming.</details>
- "Food Insecurity and Intimate Partner Violence: Evidence from the Illinois EBT Snafu of 2017" (w. C. Collins & K. Meldrum)
  - <details><summary>Abstract</summary> Intimate partner violence, colloquially referred to as ``domestic abuse'', affects millions of men, women, and children yearly in the United States. At the same time, millions of families in the United States face poverty and food insecurity, which are correlated with high rates of intimate partner violence. We exploit a random glitch in the Illinois EBT system that prevented Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits from being disbursed to 40,000 families in Illinois. We hypothesize that this will reduce intimate partner violence on days where benefits fail to renew, but increase it when benefits are restored in a large lump sum. We propose three different theoretical channels through which this may occur, based on previous literature. Preliminary results forthcoming.</details>
