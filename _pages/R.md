## Intermediate Data Analytics (DAT 280) Course Material

These are assignments I designed for the Intermediate Data Analytics course I teach at Berry College. Answer keys are not included here, since the person reading this could be my current student. However, if you would like an answer key, please e-mail me.

* [Intro to RMarkdown](/files/Intro.pdf/)
* [Basic Data Exploration in RMarkdown](/files/Iris.pdf/)



## Older projects from when I was a graduate student.

It should be noted that these tutorials were made primarily with my senior capstone students in mind when I was a graduate student. I like to think my R skills today are better than they were when I made these. If you are an advanced user of R, you may find them to be less exhaustive than a more advanced tutorial. Feel free to contact me directly if you have any questions or spot any issues in my tutorials.
