Selected Student Comments:
- "This was by far my favorite class and my favorite professor. He cared about the work he was teaching us and always
provided us with a huge amount of feedback."
- "Professor Marsella was a very strong incentive to learn throughout this class. The material was thought provoking, \[and] was taught in a way that was inspirational to research throughout things that you see in everyday society. The professor always took time to answer any questions and set apart time after class to answer any detailed questions that I might have had."
- "I think this course is great and Alex has made it even better. He really is committed to students learning and succeeding with the course material and spends the time to explain all concepts, even when we probably should already know them. He always gives weekly feedback outside of class to questions students have. I am grateful that he is my professor and I feel I have learned and retained much more knowledge because of his efforts."
- "The instructor is phenomenal in teaching this course."
- "Aex is a great professor that relates to his students well and makes me want to come to
class and learn."
- "Alex was always looking for new ways to engage his students in his class which goes a very
long way, he is great."
