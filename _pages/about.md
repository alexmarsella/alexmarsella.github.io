Welcome to my website! I am a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics and Data Analytics at Berry College's Campbell School of Business. In May of 2023, I graduated with a PhD in Economics from the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University. My research focus sits at the intersection of the applied microeconomic fields of urban, health, and public economics. Specifically, my dissertation focused on recent institutional and policy-based developments in Philadelphia that have broad implications for cities across the United States. I recently became enamored with topics in urbanism, and plan to begin doing research related to city and town design and pedestrian safety. I have also published research in the field of public choice economics. Prior to graduate school, I studied Economics and Math at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, from which I graduated in 2018. 

While a graduate student at WVU, I taught a variety of courses including principles of microeconomics, intermediate microeconomics, applied economic research, and causal inference. At Berry, I am teaching courses in economics, business statistics, and data analytics.
