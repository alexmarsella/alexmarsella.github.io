Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at West Virginia University and am currently on the 2022-2023 job market. My research focus sits at the intersection of the applied microeconomic fields of Urban, Health, and Public Economics. Specifically, my dissertation focuses on recent institutional and policy-based developments in Philadelphia that have broad implications for cities across the United States. Prior to graduate school, I studied Economics and Math at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, from which I graduated in 2018. 

My job market paper employs causal inference techniques to study the violent crime reducing effects of a previously unstudied phenomenon, the "West Philadelphia Promise Zone". It is currently under referee review. The most recent working paper version can be read [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NMmdlvz5NMGiD8ml6yWz6Rh5ZkpqBLKg/view?usp=sharing).
