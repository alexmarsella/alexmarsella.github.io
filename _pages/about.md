Welcome to my website! I am a recent PhD graduate from the Department of Economics at West Virginia University and successfully defended my dissertation in April. My research focus sits at the intersection of the applied microeconomic fields of Urban, Health, and Public Economics. Specifically, my dissertation focuses on recent institutional and policy-based developments in Philadelphia that have broad implications for cities across the United States. I recently became enamored with topics in urbanism, and plan to begin doing research related to city and town design and pedestrian safety. Prior to graduate school, I studied Economics and Math at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, from which I graduated in 2018. 

My job market paper employs causal inference and GIS techniques in R to study the violent crime reducing effects of a previously unstudied phenomenon, the "West Philadelphia Promise Zone". The most recent working paper version can be read [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3956747).

In the Fall, I will be joining the Campbell School of Business at Berry College as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics and Data Analytics.
