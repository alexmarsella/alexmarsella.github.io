Welcome to my website! I am an Assistant Professor of Economics and Data Analytics at Berry College's Campbell School of Business. In May of 2023, I graduated with a PhD in Economics from the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University. My research focuses on policy changes in large cities, such as Philadelphia and New York, and how those policy changes affect a variety of outcomes, such as crime, property values, or other economic indicators. I have also published research in the field of public choice economics. 

While a graduate student at WVU, I taught a variety of courses including principles of microeconomics, intermediate microeconomics, applied economic research, and causal inference. At Berry, I teach courses in economics, business statistics, and data analytics. This fall, I am teaching introductory economics and intermediate microeconomics.
