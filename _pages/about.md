Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at West Virginia University and will be defending my dissertation in April. My research focus sits at the intersection of the applied microeconomic fields of Urban, Health, and Public Economics. Specifically, my dissertation focuses on recent institutional and policy-based developments in Philadelphia that have broad implications for cities across the United States. Prior to graduate school, I studied Economics and Math at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, from which I graduated in 2018. 

My job market paper employs causal inference and GIS techniques in R to study the violent crime reducing effects of a previously unstudied phenomenon, the "West Philadelphia Promise Zone". It is currently under referee review. The most recent working paper version can be read [here](https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3956747).

In Fall 2023, I will be joining the Campbell School of Business at Berry College as a Visiting Assistant Professor of Economics and Data Analytics.
