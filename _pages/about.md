Welcome to my website! I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Economics at West Virginia University. My research focus sits at the intersection of the applied microeconomic fields of Urban, Health, and Public Economics. Specifically, my dissertation focuses on recent institutional and policy-based developments in Philadelphia that have broad implications for cities across the United States. Prior to graduate school, I studied Economics and Math at West Chester University of Pennsylvania, from which I graduated in 2018. I will be on the job market in the upcoming 2022-2023 academic year.

My job market paper employs modern causal inference techniques to study the violent crime reducing effects of a previously unstudied phenomenon, the "West Philadelphia Promise Zone". It is currently under referee review at the <i> Journal of Urban Economics </i>.
